software-development,Programming Languages~ Part A ,"This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages~ with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML~ Racket~ and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts~ but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages~ you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust~ reusable~ composable~ and elegant programs. Indeed~ many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.

The course assumes some prior experience with programming~ as described in more detail in the first module.

The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A~ Part B~ and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A~ the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material~ so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.

Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course~ but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean."

software-development,Beginning Game Programming with C# ,"The Beginning Game Programming with C# course is all about learning how to develop video games using the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++~ Java~ ActionScript~ or some other programming language you may have heard of? First~ using C# lets us use the open-source MonoGame framework~ which help us quickly develop games for Windows~ Android~ iOS~ Mac OS X~ and others. Second~ the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers~ and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. And finally~ C# is a really good language for learning how to program.

That learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building a small~ complete game by the end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages~ including C#~ and you'll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world~ updating the game world based on user input and simple physics~ playing music and sound effects in your games~ and so on.

Computer programming is really fun in general~ and programming games is even better!

Caution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do~ especially since this course is essentially a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you~ but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way."
software-development,Digital Product Management: Modern Fundamentals ,"Not so long ago~ the job of product manager was about assessing market data~ creating requirements~ and managing the hand-off to sales/marketing. Maybe you’d talk to a customer somewhere in there and they’d tell you what features they wanted. But companies that manage product that way are dying.

Being a product person today is a new game~ and product managers are at the center of it. Today~ particularly if your product is mostly digital~ you might update it several times a day. Massive troves of data are available for making decisions and~ at the same time~ deep insights into customer motivation and experience are more important than ever. The job of the modern product manager is to charter a direction and create a successful working environment for all the actors involved in product success.  It’s not a simple job or an easy job~ but it is a meaningful job where you’ll be learning all the time. 

This course will help you along your learning journey and prepare you with the skills and perspective you need to:

Create the actionable focus to successfully manage your product (week 1)
Focus your work using modern product management methods (week 2)
Manage new products and explore new product ideas (week 3)
Manage and amplify existing products (week 4)

This course is ideal for current product or general  managers interested in today's modern product management methods.

You will develop an app from scratch~ assuming a basic knowledge of Java~ and learn how to set up Android Studio~ work with various Activities and create simple user interfaces to make your apps run smoothly.
software-development,The Unix Workbench ,"Unix forms a foundation that is often very helpful for accomplishing other goals you might have for you and your computer~ whether that goal is running a business~ writing a book~ curing disease~ or creating the next great app. The means to these goals are sometimes carried out by writing software. Software can’t be mined out of the ground~ nor can software seeds be planted in spring to harvest by autumn. Software isn’t produced in factories on an assembly line. Software is a hand-made~ often bespoke good. If a software developer is an artisan~ then Unix is their workbench. Unix provides an essential and simple set of tools in a distraction-free environment. Even if you’re not a software developer learning Unix can open you up to new methods of thinking and novel ways to scale your ideas. 

This course is intended for folks who are new to programming and new to Unix-like operating systems like macOS and Linux distributions like Ubuntu. Most of the technologies discussed in this course will be accessed via a command line interface. Command line interfaces can seem alien at first~ so this course attempts to draw parallels between using the command line and actions that you would normally take while using your mouse and keyboard. You’ll also learn how to write little pieces of software in a programming language called Bash~ which allows you to connect together the tools we’ll discuss. My hope is that by the end of this course you be able to use different Unix tools as if they’re interconnecting Lego bricks."
software-development,A developer's guide to the Internet of Things (IoT) ,">>> By enrolling in this course you agree to the End User License Agreement as set out in the FAQ.  Once enrolled you can access the license in the Resources area <<<

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an area of rapid growth and opportunity. Technical innovations in networks~ sensors and applications~ coupled with the advent of 'smart machines' have resulted in a huge diversity of devices generating all kinds of structured and unstructured data that needs to be processed somewhere.  Collecting and understanding that data~ combining it with other sources of information and putting it to good  use can be achieved by using connectivity~ analytical and cognitive services now available on the cloud~ allowing development and deployment of solutions to be achieved faster and more efficiently than ever before.

This course is an entry level introduction to developing and deploying solutions for the Internet of Things. It will focus on capturing data from a trusted device and sending the data to a cloud platform where it can be exploited by the many services available. You will explore all the steps required to create a basic IoT solution using a popular device~ the Raspberry Pi~ and a trial version of the cloud-based IBM Watson IoT Platform. 

What you will learn: 
Quickly create applications that leverage connectivity and analytics as part of an integrated IoT platform.  Use Node-RED~ an open-source visual application development environment~ on both the device and the cloud.  Create a basic IoT solution by leveraging pre-built blocks of code that abstracts and speeds the development process. Use APIs to access the platform and explore the different connectivity options for various devices~ gateways and applications. Explore options to ensure your solution makes best use of the captured data. 
 
What technology is required to complete the course?  
The programming assignments require you to have a Raspberry Pi device - any model of Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. The course also uses the SenseHAT extension board~ whilst it is preferable to have a SenseHat there is a simulator provided if you can't get a SenseHAT.  

You will need internet connectivity to download software~ connect to the platform~ develop and deploy your IoT solution.

Your Rasberry Pi will need the latest Rasbian Jessie OS. This OS will be on a Micro SD Card. The recommended size of the SD card is 8GB but 4GB will do. Note that the learner kit comes with a preconfigured SD card.

In order to setup the Micro SD card~ you will need a computer with either a windows~ apple or Linux OS. Since most computer do not have a micro SD port~ you will need a Micro SD adapter or USB Micro SD card adapter. Your computer will also be used when working on the platform.

To work on your Raspberry Pi~ you will need an HDMI monitor or TV to work as the display for the Raspberry Pi (DVI monitor will also work). To connect the monitor to the Raspberry Pi you will need an HDMI cable (or a DVI to HDMI cable).
Your Raspberry Pi needs a way to connect to the internet; either an Ethernet cable for connecting to the Router~ or a USB WiFi dongle if you have wireless connectivity. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in WiFi
A USB Keyboard and mouse.

Your Raspberry Pi will also needs a 5V micro USB power supply i(This may be a phone charger for example)
There is an IoT Learner kit available from element14 which includes the Raspberry Pi~ a pre-flashed SD card~ a case and power supply : https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-82034/l/element14-iot-learner-kit 

What prerequisite skills are required ?
This is an entry level course~ but does assume you have basic programming skills. The assignments set use both Python and JavaScript programming languages~ so some basic skill in these languages is required. No previous experience with IBM Bluemix or the IBM Watson IoT Platform is required.

What additional resources do I need for this course? 
The Server side code for the assignments will use the IBM Bluemix cloud platform~ so you will need to sign up for a free account on that platform.

When your 30-day trial expires~ you can enter a credit card to keep using Bluemix. Bluemix has a set amount of free resources available to users who have registered with their credit card. If you stay within these free resources limits you will not incur any charges. This is a good idea if you are planning to take longer than 30 days to complete the course~ or if you have an existing trial account that that is about to expire and you need longer time on the platform to complete the course."
software-development,Algorithms on Graphs ,"If you have ever used a navigation service to find optimal route and estimate time to destination~ you've used algorithms on graphs. Graphs arise in various real-world situations as there are road networks~ computer networks and~ most recently~ social networks! If you're looking for the fastest time to get to work~ cheapest way to connect set of computers into a network or efficient algorithm to automatically find communities and opinion leaders in Facebook~ you're going to work with graphs and algorithms on graphs.

In this course~ you will first learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then you'll learn several ways to traverse graphs and how you can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. We will then talk about shortest paths algorithms — from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services. You will use these algorithms if you choose to work on our Fast Shortest Routes industrial capstone project. We will finish with minimum spanning trees which are used to plan road~ telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms."
software-development,Design Patterns ,"Design problems in applications can be resolved through design patterns commonly applied by experts. This course extends object-oriented analysis and design by incorporating design patterns to create interactive applications. Through a survey of established design patterns~ learners will gain a foundation for more complex software applications. Finally~ learners will identify problematic software designs by referencing a catalog of code smells.

Learners will be challenged in the capstone project to critique an existing Java application for code smells. They will redesign the application to combine design patterns such as within the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design. 

After completing this course~ a learner will be able to: 
• Demonstrate how to use design patterns to address user interface design issues.	
• Identify the most suitable design pattern to address a given application design problem.	
• Apply design principles (e.g.~ open-closed~ dependency inversion~ least knowledge).	
• Critique code by identifying and refactoring anti-patterns.
• Apply the model-view-controller architectural pattern."
software-development,Parallel Programming in Java ,"This course teaches learners (industry professionals and students) the fundamental concepts of parallel programming in the context of Java 8. Parallel programming enables developers to use multicore computers to make their applications run faster by using multiple processors at the same time. By the end of this course~ you will learn how to use popular parallel Java frameworks (such as ForkJoin~ Stream~ and Phaser) to write parallel programs for a wide range of multicore platforms including servers~ desktops~ or mobile devices~ while also learning about their theoretical foundations including computation graphs~ ideal parallelism~ parallel speedup~ Amdahl's Law~ data races~ and determinism.

Why take this course?

•	All computers are multicore computers~ so it is important for you to learn how to extend your knowledge of sequential Java programming to multicore parallelism.
•	Java 7 and Java 8 have introduced new frameworks for parallelism (ForkJoin~ Stream) that have significantly changed the paradigms for parallel programming since the early days of Java.
•	Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own~ after the course ends.
•	During the course~ you will have online access to the instructor and the mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on forums.

The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:

software-development,The Finite Element Method for Problems in Physics ,"This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences. The treatment is mathematical~ but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern~ open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications~ subsequently.

The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an
introductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical~ which is
natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not
formal~ however~ because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a
competent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional
analysis~ and variational calculus~ but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the
methods~ which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite
Element Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical
foundation~ and this needs to be appreciated~ even if only in the elementary manner
presented here. A background in PDEs and~ more importantly~ linear algebra~ is assumed~
although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.

The development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs):
elliptic~ parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage~ however~ we make numerous connections to
the physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in
one dimension (linearized elasticity~ steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We
then move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and
mass diffusion)~ before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems
in vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next
(unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion)~ and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in
three dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to
questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who
followed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures~ we interrupt the mathematical
development to lay out the code framework~ which is entirely open source~ and C++ based.

Books:
There are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required
textbook. However~ we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader
treatments than can be provided in any form of class:

The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis~ T.J.R.
Hughes~ Dover Publications~ 2000.

The Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals~ O.C. Zienkiewicz~ R.L. Taylor and
J.Z. Zhu~ Butterworth-Heinemann~ 2005.

A First Course in Finite Elements~ J. Fish and T. Belytschko~ Wiley~ 2007.

Resources:
You can download the deal.ii library at dealii.org. The lectures include coding tutorials where
we list other resources that you can use if you are unable to install deal.ii on your own
computer. You will need cmake to run deal.ii. It is available at cmake.org."
software-development,Control of Mobile Robots ,Control of Mobile Robots is a course that focuses on the application of modern control theory to the problem of making robots move around in safe and effective ways. The structure of this class is somewhat unusual since it involves many moving parts - to do robotics right~ one has to go from basic theory all the way to an actual robot moving around in the real world~ which is the challenge we have set out to address through the different pieces in the course.
software-development,Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments ,"Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments is the first course of the upcoming Embedded Software Essentials Specialization. This course is focused on giving you real world coding experience and hands on project work with ARM based Microcontrollers.

Course assignments include creating a build system using the GNU Toolchain GCC~ using Git version control~ and developing software in Linux on a Virtual Machine. The course concludes with a project where you will create your own build system and firmware that can manipulate memory.

Later courses of the Specialization will use hardware tools to program and debug microcontrollers with bare-metal firmware. Using a Texas Instruments MSP432 Development Kit~ you will configure a variety of peripherals~ write numerous programs~ and see your work execute on your own embedded platform!"
software-development,Introduction to UI Design ,"In this course~ you will gain an understanding of the critical importance of user interface design. You will also learn industry-standard methods for how to approach the design of a user interface and key theories and frameworks that underlie the design of most interfaces you use today.

Through a series of case studies on commercial systems - many of which you likely use on a regular basis - we will illustrate the benefits of good design. We will also demonstrate how the costs of bad design can often be severe (in user experience~ money~ and even human lives).

You will then gain a high-level understanding of the user-interface design process. You will be introduced to common design scenarios - e.g. improving on existing designs and starting a new design from scratch - and the general design processes that tend to be used for each scenario.

Finally~ we will begin introducing the large body of existing knowledge on design by providing overviews of core user interface design theories and concepts. This key foundational information will help you avoid “reinventing the wheel” when you are designing your interfaces in this specialization."

This is the third course in a specialization called Software Design & Architecture. If you were with us for the first two courses~ you’ve put in a lot of hard work to get here. We are so happy to have you back!. If you are just joining us~ welcome! We have two courses before this one~ called “Object-Oriented Design” and “Design Patterns”. These are foundational to Software Architecture~ but you can take this course as a stand-alone one if it suits you and your goals!

In this course we will talk about software architecture. Architecture is the high-level form of the software design~ so we are no longer talking about objects and classes~ but components. Components are software units - subroutines~ classes~ functions~ etc. - that are grouped on the basis of separation of concerns. The way that these components are arranged~ and the interactions between them~ are called the architecture.

We will discuss the ways these architectures are represented~ both in UML and other visual tools~ and introduce the most common architectures~ their qualities~ and tradeoffs. In the last module~ we will talk about how architectures are evaluated; what makes a good architecture? how can it be made better? We'll also talk about how the architecture touches on the process of software development. All the while you'll be practicing these architectures yourself and gaining hands-on experience.

We have estimated that you will need about 4 hours per week to get the most out of this course~ so it is hard work~ but worth the effort. Good luck!

Upon completion of this course~ a learner will be able to…	
• Compare and contrast the components~ connections~ protocols~ topologies~ constraints~ tradeoffs~ and variations of different types of architectural styles used in the design of applications and systems (e.g.~ main program and subroutine~ object-oriented~ interpreters~ pipes and filters~ database centric~ event-based).	
• Describe the properties of layered and n-tier architectures.

software-development,Rails with Active Record and Action Pack ,"You already know how to build a basic web application with the Ruby on Rails framework. Perhaps~ you have even taken Course 1~ ""Ruby on Rails: An Introduction"" (we highly recommend it) where you relied on external web services to be your “data layer”. But in the back of your mind~ you always knew that there would come a time when you would need to roll up your sleeves and learn SQL to be able to interact with your own relational database (RDBMS). But there is an easier way to get started with SQL using the Active Record Object/Relational (ORM) framework. In this course~ we will be able to use the Ruby language and the Active Record ORM framework to automate interactions with the database to quickly build the application we want.
 
In Rails with Active Record and Action Pack~ we will explore how to interact with relational databases by using Active Record~ a Ruby gem~ which Rails uses by default for database access. We will then take a look at what role Active Record plays in the overall request-response cycle~ when a client (the browser) requests data from the server~ as well as how to submit the data to the server.  Of course~ when accessing data~ security is of paramount importance! We will talk about vulnerabilities such as SQL injection~ as well as how to secure access to data by authenticating and authorizing users accessing the data. Take this course to build a Ruby on Rails application with Active Record to automate the detailed SQL interactions with our database."

software-development,System Validation: Automata and behavioural equivalences ,"Have you ever experienced software systems failing? Websites crash~ calendar not synchronising~ or even a power blackout. Of course you have! But did you know that many of these errors are the result of communication errors either within a system or between systems? Depending on the system~ the impact of software failures can be huge~ even resulting in massive economic damage or loss of lives. Software~ and in particular the communication between software-intensive systems~ is very complex and very difficult to get right. However~ we _need_ dependability in the systems we use~ directly or indirectly~ to support us in our everyday lives.

System Validation helps you to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound. It also enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful; systems that are designed for sound behaviour are also much easier to maintain and adapt. System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. The techniques put forward in system validaton allow to prove the absence of errors. 

This first course ’Automata and behavioural equivalences'~ builds the foundation of the subsequent courses~ showing you how to look at system behaviour as state machines. It discusses behavioural equivalences and illustrate these in a number of examples and quizzes. This course explains labelled transition systems or automata to model behaviour for especially software controlled systems. An important question is when two behaviours represented by such automata are equal. The answer to this question is not at all straightforward~ but the resulting equivalences are used as powerful tools to simplify complex behaviour. This allows us to exactly investigate and understand the behavioural properties of such systems precisely. Especially~ in the combination with hiding of behaviour~ equivalence reduction is a unique technique to obtain insight in the behaviour of systems~ far more effective than simulation or testing. Using this insight we can make the models correct. Such models form an excellent basis for the production of concise~ reliable and maintainable software.

This course is part I of the set of courses for System Validation. System Validation~ as a set of courses~ is part of a larger EIT Digital online programme called 'Internet of Things through Embedded Systems'."
software-development,Building Interactive 3D Characters and Social VR ,"Meeting another person is one of the most amazing experiences you can have in Virtual Reality. It is quite unlike communicating through any other medium except a real life face-to-face conversation. Because the other person is life size and shares a virtual space with you~ body language works in a way that cannot be done on a flat screen. This course will enable you to create realistic social interactions in VR. 

You will learn about both the psychology of social interaction and the practical skills to implement it in Unity3D. We will take you through the basics of 3D character animation and how to create body language. You will learn about how to make characters that can respond to players’ speech and body language. You will also learn about avatars: the virtual representation of other players~ and agents: computer controlled NPC characters and how to implement both of them. 

As many people have said before us~ social is the future of VR. This course will help you become part of the future of Virtual Reality social experiences."

software-development,Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis ,"Welcome to Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis. In this course~ you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in a fashion popular in theoretical computer science~ and generally train your abstract thinking skills.   

After finishing this course~ you have learned to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption~ and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets~ about timing~ and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems~ and for the special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs~ you will know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics~ like throughput~ latency and buffering.

Disclaimer: As you will notice~ there is an abundance of small examples in this course~ but at first sight there are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly~ it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather~ I would like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general and abstract terms~ because that is what you will need to do whenever you encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all~ abstract thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in any engineering discipline~ and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically~ it will become easier for you to spot mistakes~ to communicate your ideas with others~ and you have already made a big step towards actually solving the problem. Secondly~ although dataflow techniques are applicable and being used in industry~ the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles of other dataflow techniques~ however~ are all based on single-rate dataflow. So this course is a good primer for any more advanced course on the topic.

This course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital university~ and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven)~ TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente).

software-development,System Validation (2): Model process behaviour ,"System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. It is the next logical step in computer science and improving software development in general. It allows automated analysis based on behavioural models of a system to see if a system works correctly. We want to guarantee that the systems does exactly what it is supposed to do. The techniques put forward in system validation allow to prove the absence of errors. It allows to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound and as a side effect enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful. This means that the systems are not only behaving correctly~ but are also much easier to maintain and adapt. ’Model process behaviour' is the follow up MOOC to 'Automata and behavioural equivalences'. This MOOC shows you how to model process behaviour~ in particular protocols and distributed algorithms~ dive deeper in the properties of system behaviour~ and keep things simple to avoid a state space explosion.

software-development,Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story ,"Learn about traditional and mobile malware~ the security threats they represent~ state-of-the-art analysis and detection techniques~ and the underground ecosystem that drives such a profitable but illegal business.

Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story is a short~ introductory~ and experimental (i.e.~ pilot) course featuring 6 lectures. Each lecture lasts roughly anything between 1h and 1.5h and is logically divided in a number of ~15 mins self-contained units. Although a non-negligible effort has been made to fulfill this breakdown~ some units last definitely longer and require a bit more effort---just pause the video and take a break ;-)

In addition~ the course features 6 multiple-choices mandatory quizzes (i.e.~ 1 per lecture) and 1 bonus quiz. Passing all the mandatory quizzes awards a ""pass"" mark of the course~ while passing all the mandatory quizzes and the bonus one awards a ""distinction"" mark."
software-development,Quantitative Model Checking ,"The integration of ICT (information and communications technology) in different applications is rapidly increasing in e.g. Embedded and Cyber physical systems~ Communication protocols and Transportation systems. Hence~ their reliability and dependability increasingly depends on software. Defects can be fatal and extremely costly (with regards to mass-production of products and safety-critical systems).

First~ a model of the real system has to be built. In the simplest case~ the model reflects all possible states that the system can reach and all possible transitions between states in a (labelled) State Transition System. When adding probabilities and discrete time to the model~ we are dealing with so-called Discrete-time Markov chains which in turn can be extended with continuous timing to Continuous-time Markov chains. Both formalisms have been used widely for modeling and performance and dependability evaluation of computer and communication systems in a wide variety of domains. These formalisms are well understood~ mathematically attractive while at the same time flexible enough to model complex systems. 

Model checking focuses on the qualitative evaluation of the model. As formal verification method~ model checking analyzes
the functionality of the system model. A property that needs to be analyzed has to be specified in a logic with consistent syntax and semantics. For every state of the model~ it is then checked whether the property is valid or not.
The main focus of this course is on quantitative model checking for Markov chains~ for which we will discuss efficient computational algorithms. The learning objectives of this course are as follows:

- Express dependability properties for different kinds of transition systems .
- Compute the evolution over time for Markov chains.
- Check whether single states satisfy a certain formula and compute the satisfaction set for properties."

software-development,The Fundamentals of Computing Capstone Exam ,"While most specializations on Coursera conclude with a project-based course~ students in the ""Fundamentals of Computing"" specialization have completed more than 20+ projects during the first six courses of the specialization. Given that much of the material in these courses is reused from session to session~ our goal in this capstone class is to provide a conclusion to the specialization that allows each student an opportunity to demonstrate their individual mastery of the material in the specialization.

With this objective in mind~ the focus in this Capstone class will be an exam whose questions are updated periodically. This approach is designed to help insure that each student is solving the exam problems on his/her own without outside help. For students that have done their own work~ we do not anticipate that the exam will be particularly hard. However~ those students who have relied too heavily on outside help in previous classes may have a difficult time. We believe that this approach will increase the value of the Certificate for this specialization."
software-development,"Capstone MOOC for ""Android App Development"" ",The Capstone project integrates material from throughout the Android App Development Specialization to exercise and assess the ability of learners to create an interesting Android app. Learners will apply knowledge and skills learned in previous MOOCs in this Specialization~ including Java programming features; Android activity~ broadcast receiver~ service~ and content provider (plus SQLite) components; and unit~ integration~ and user interface testing.

software-development,Data Mining Project ,"Note: You should complete all the other courses in this Specialization before beginning this course.

This six-week long Project course of the Data Mining Specialization will allow you to apply the learned algorithms and techniques for data mining from the previous courses in the Specialization~ including Pattern Discovery~ Clustering~ Text Retrieval~ Text Mining~ and Visualization~ to solve interesting real-world data mining challenges. Specifically~ you will work on a restaurant review data set from Yelp and use all the knowledge and skills you’ve learned from the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge. The design of the Project emphasizes: 1) simulating the workflow of a data miner in a real job setting; 2) integrating different mining techniques covered in multiple individual courses; 3) experimenting with different ways to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques; and 4) allowing you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively. 

The goal of the Project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. The project will include the following outputs: 

1. Opinion visualization: explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.
2. Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities.
3. Discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes of a particular cuisine.
4. Recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.

From the perspective of users~ a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they decide what cuisine to try~ they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally~ they will need to choose a restaurant. Thus~ recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful. Moreover~ predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant would also be helpful. 

By working on these tasks~ you will gain experience with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing~ data exploration~ data analysis~ improvement of analysis methods~ and presentation of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve it. We will suggest specific approaches~ but you are highly encouraged to explore your own ideas since open exploration is~ by design~ a goal of the Project. 

You are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks for peer grading. A final consolidated report is also required~ which will be peer-graded."
software-development,Introduction to Programming with MATLAB ,"This course teaches computer programming to those with little to no previous experience. It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn~ versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex~ while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative~ that is~ to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language~ such as C++ or Java. As a result~ MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences~ through all disciplines of engineering~ to finance~ and beyond~ and it is heavily used in industry. Hence~ a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.

Nevertheless~ this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming.

Digital images and videos are everywhere these days – in thousands of scientific (e.g.~ astronomical~ bio-medical)~ consumer~ industrial~ and artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students~ software developers~ and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g.~ removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car)~ and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online~ or share photos via a social media website~ you use this everyday!)~ for economical storage and efficient transmission.

This is evidenced by the popularity of MapReduce and Hadoop~ and most recently Apache Spark~ a fast~ in-memory distributed collections framework written in Scala. In this course~ we'll see how the data parallel paradigm can be extended to the distributed case~ using Spark throughout. We'll cover Spark's programming model in detail~ being careful to understand how and when it differs from familiar programming models~ like shared-memory parallel collections or sequential Scala collections.

This course is intended to be taken after Parallel Programming: https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1."
algorithms,What is a Proof? ,"There is a perceived barrier to mathematics: proofs. In this course we will try to convince you that this barrier is more frightening than prohibitive: most proofs are easy to understand if explained correctly~ and often they are even fun. We provide an accompanied excursion in the “proof zoo” showing you examples of techniques of different kind applied to different topics.

We use some puzzles as examples~ not because they are “practical”~ but because discussing them we learn important reasoning and problem solving techniques that are useful. We hope you enjoy playing with the puzzles and inventing/understandings the proofs.

As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g.~ we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions)~ basic programming in python (functions~ loops~ recursion)~ common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT~ starting from motivated high school students."

If you're looking for the fastest time to get to work~ cheapest way to connect set of computers into a network or efficient algorithm to automatically find communities and opinion leaders in Facebook~ you're going to work with graphs and algorithms on graphs.

In this course~ you will first learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then you'll learn several ways to traverse graphs and how you can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. We will then talk about shortest paths algorithms — from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services. You will use these algorithms if you choose to work on our Fast Shortest Routes industrial capstone project. We will finish with minimum spanning trees which are used to plan road~ telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms."
algorithms,Discrete Mathematics ,"Discrete mathematics forms the mathematical foundation of computer and information science. It is also a fascinating subject in itself.

Learners will become familiar with a broad range of mathematical objects like sets~ functions~ relations~ graphs~ that are omnipresent in computer science. Perhaps more importantly~ they will reach a certain level of mathematical maturity - being able to  understand formal statements and their proofs; coming up with rigorous proofs themselves; and coming up with interesting results.

This course attempts to be rigorous without being overly formal. This means~ for every concept we introduce we will show at least one interesting and non-trivial result and give a full proof. However~ we will do so without too much formal notation~ employing examples and figures whenever possible.

The main topics of this course are (1) sets~ functions~ relations~ (2) enumerative combinatorics~ (3) graph theory~ (4) network flow and matchings. It does not cover modular arithmetic~ algebra~ and logic~ since these topics have a slightly different flavor and because there are already several courses on Coursera specifically on these topics."
algorithms,Computational Investing~ Part I ,Why do the prices of some companies’ stocks seem to move up and down together while others move separately? What does portfolio “diversification” really mean and how important is it? What should the price of a stock be? How can we discover and exploit the relationships between equity prices automatically? We’ll examine these questions~ and others~ from a computational point of view. You will learn many of the principles and algorithms that hedge funds and investment professionals use to maximize return and reduce risk in equity portfolios.

Last century is noted for the creation of machines which can operate other machines. Nowadays the creation of devices that interact with the physical world is available to anyone. 
Our course consists of a series of practical problems on making things that work independently: they make their own decisions~ act~ move~ communicate with each other and people around~ and control other devices. We will demonstrate how to assemble such devices and programme them using the Arduino platform as a basis.
After this course~ you will be able to create devices that read the data about the external world with a variety of sensors~ receive and forward this data to a PC~ the Internet and mobile devices~ and control indexing and the movement. The creation of such devices will involve design~ the study of their components~ the assemblage of circuit boards~ coding and diagnostics. Along with the creation of the devices themselves~ you will perform visualization on a PC~ create a web page that will demonstrate one of your devices~ and figure out how an FDM 3D-printer is configured and how it functions.   
Besides those keen on robotics or looking to broaden their horizons and develop their skills~ the course will also be useful to anyone facing the task of home and industrial automation~ as well as to anyone engaged in industrial design~ advertising and art. 
The course does not require any special knowledge from the participants and is open even to students of upper secondary school. Programming skills and the level of English allowing to read technical documentation would be an advantage~ but this is not obligatory.
The entire course is dedicated to practice~ so the best way for you would be to get hold of some electronics~ follow the illustrated examples and experiment on your own.

This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat.

In the first half of the course~ we investigate DNA replication~ and ask the question~ where in the genome does DNA replication begin?  We will see that we can answer this question for many bacteria using only some straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages in the genome.

In the second half of the course~ we examine a different biological question~ when we ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks.  The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm~ but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again~ we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for~ we can start to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA.  Perhaps surprisingly~ we will apply randomized algorithms~ which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems.

algorithms,Data Structures and Performance ,"How do Java programs deal with vast quantities of data? Many of the data structures and algorithms that work with introductory toy examples break when applications process real~ large data sets.  Efficiency is critical~ but how do we achieve it~ and how do we even measure it?

This is an intermediate Java course. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science~ and in particular~ we recommend that you have taken the first course in this specialization (which also requires some previous experience with Java).  

In this course~ you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications~ such as linked lists~ trees~ and hashtables.  You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval~ addition of new data~ deletion of elements~ and/or memory usage.

The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage~ manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data.  This is an intermediate Java course~ and we will build on your prior knowledge.  This course is designed around  the same video series as in our first course in this specialization~ including explanations of core content~ learner videos~ student and engineer testimonials~ and support videos -- to better allow you to choose your own path through the course!"
algorithms,Algorithms on Strings ,World and internet is full of textual information. We search for information using textual queries~ we read websites~ books~ e-mails. All those are strings from the point of view of computer science. To make sense of all that information and make search efficient~ search engines use many string algorithms. Moreover~ the emerging field of personalized medicine uses many search algorithms to find disease-causing mutations in the human genome.
algorithms,Discrete Optimization ,"Tired of solving Sudokus by hand? This class teaches you how to solve complex search problems with discrete optimization concepts and algorithms~ including constraint programming~ local search~ and mixed-integer programming.

Optimization technology is ubiquitous in our society. It schedules planes and their crews~ coordinates the production of steel~ and organizes the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Optimization clears the day-ahead and real-time markets to deliver electricity to millions of people. It organizes kidney exchanges and cancer treatments and helps scientists understand the fundamental fabric of life~ control complex chemical reactions~ and design drugs that may benefit billions of individuals.

This class is an introduction to discrete optimization and exposes students to some of the most fundamental concepts and algorithms in the field. It covers constraint programming~ local search~ and mixed-integer programming from their foundations to their applications for complex practical problems in areas such as scheduling~ vehicle routing~ supply-chain optimization~ and resource allocation."
algorithms,Introduction to Graph Theory ,"We invite you to a fascinating journey into Graph Theory — an area which connects the elegance of painting and the rigor of mathematics;  is simple~ but not unsophisticated. Graph Theory gives us~ both an easy way to pictorially represent many major mathematical results~ and insights into the deep theories behind them. 

In this course~ among other intriguing applications~ we will see how GPS systems find shortest routes~ how engineers design integrated circuits~ how biologists assemble genomes~ why a political map can always be colored using a few colors. We will study Ramsey Theory which proves that in a large system~ complete disorder is impossible!

This is the first course in the Genomic Data Science Specialization."
algorithms,Advanced Algorithms and Complexity ,You've learned the basic algorithms now and are ready to step into the area of more complex problems and algorithms to solve them. Advanced algorithms build upon basic ones and use new ideas. We will start with networks flows which are used in more typical applications such as optimal matchings~ finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision. We then proceed to linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation~ portfolio optimization~ finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements and many others. Next we discuss inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them in practice. We finish with a soft introduction to streaming algorithms that are heavily used in Big Data processing. Such algorithms are usually designed to be able to process huge datasets without being able even to store a dataset.
algorithms,Combinatorics and Probability ,"Counting is one of the basic mathematically related tasks we encounter on a day to day basis. The main question here is the following. If we need to count something~ can we do anything better than just counting all objects one by one? Do we need to create a list of all phone numbers to ensure that there are enough phone numbers for everyone? Is there a way to tell that our algorithm will run in a reasonable time before implementing and actually running it? All these questions are addressed by a mathematical field called Combinatorics.

In this course we discuss most standard combinatorial settings that can help to answer questions of this type. We will especially concentrate on developing the ability to distinguish these settings in real life and algorithmic problems. This will help the learner to actually implement new knowledge. Apart from that we will discuss recursive technique for counting that is important for algorithmic implementations.

One of the main `consumers’ of Combinatorics is Probability Theory. This area is connected with numerous sides of life~ on one hand being an important concept in everyday life and on the other hand being an indispensable tool in such modern and important fields as Statistics and Machine Learning. In this course we will concentrate on providing the working knowledge of basics of probability and a good intuition in this area. The practice shows that such an intuition is not easy to develop.

In the end of the course we will create a program that successfully plays a tricky and very counterintuitive dice game.

As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g.~ we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions)~ basic programming in python (functions~ loops~ recursion)~ common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT~ starting from motivated high school students."

algorithms,Probabilistic Graphical Models 3: Learning ,"Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are a rich framework for encoding probability distributions over complex domains: joint (multivariate) distributions over large numbers of random variables that interact with each other. These representations sit at the intersection of statistics and computer science~ relying on concepts from probability theory~ graph algorithms~ machine learning~ and more. They are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications~ such as medical diagnosis~ image understanding~ speech recognition~ natural language processing~ and many~ many more. They are also a foundational tool in formulating many machine learning problems. 

This course is the third in a sequence of three. Following the first course~ which focused on representation~ and the second~ which focused on inference~ this course addresses the question of learning: how a PGM can be learned from a data set of examples. The course discusses the key problems of parameter estimation in both directed and undirected models~ as well as the structure learning task for directed models. The (highly recommended) honors track contains two hands-on programming assignments~ in which key routines of two commonly used learning algorithms are implemented and applied to a real-world problem."
algorithms,Number Theory and Cryptography ,"We all learn numbers from the childhood. Some of us like to count~ others hate it~ but any person uses numbers everyday to buy things~ pay for services~ estimated time and necessary resources. People have been wondering about numbers’ properties for thousands of years. And for thousands of years it was more or less just a game that was only interesting for pure mathematicians. Famous 20th century mathematician G.H. Hardy once said “The Theory of Numbers has always been regarded as one of the most obviously useless branches of Pure Mathematics”. Just 30 years after his death~ an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory. It was called RSA after the names of its authors~ and its implementation is probably the most frequently used computer program in the word nowadays. Without it~ nobody would be able to make secure payments over the internet~ or even log in securely to e-mail and other personal services. In this short course~ we will make the whole journey from the foundation to RSA in 4 weeks. By the end~ you will be able to apply the basics of the number theory to encrypt and decrypt messages~ and to break the code if one applies RSA carelessly. You will even pass a cryptographic quest!

As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g.~ we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions)~ basic programming in python (functions~ loops~ recursion)~ common sense and curiosity.

Needless to say~ when you master these high-demand skills~ you will be well positioned to apply for or move to positions in biomedical data analytics and bioinformatics. No matter what your skill levels are in biomedical or technical areas~ you will gain highly valuable new or sharpened skills that will make you stand-out as a professional and want to dive even deeper in biomedical Big Data.

How efficiently can you pack objects into a minimum number of boxes? How well can you cluster nodes so as to cheaply separate a network into components around a few centers? These are examples of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. It is most likely impossible to solve such problems efficiently~ so our aim is to give an approximate solution that can be computed in polynomial time and that at the same time has provable guarantees on its cost relative to the optimum. 

This course assumes knowledge of a standard undergraduate Algorithms course~ and particularly emphasizes algorithms that can be designed using linear programming~ a favorite and amazingly successful technique in this area.

Biologists still cannot read the nucleotides of an entire genome as you would read a book from beginning to end. However~ they can read short pieces of DNA. In this course~ we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces.

Looking at the human and mouse genomes~ we will ask ourselves: just as earthquakes are much more likely to occur along fault lines~ are there locations in our genome that are ""fragile"" and more susceptible to be broken as part of genome rearrangements?  We will see how combinatorial algorithms will help us answer this question.

We still don’t have provably efficient algorithms for this difficult computational problem and this is the essence of the P versus NP problem~ the most important open question in Computer Science. Still~ we’ll implement several efficient solutions for real world instances of the travelling salesman problem.

Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and ""map"" them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient~ requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.

In the second half of the course~ we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.

The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.

In six weeks students will be guided through the basics of Reinforcement Learning (RL):  we will talk about essential theory of RL~ value-based methods (such as SARSA and Q-learning)~ policy based algorithms and methods~ designed to solve the optimal exploration problem. In addition to algorithms and theory~ during the course we will also present useful practical tips and tricks~ needed for learning stabilization~ and study how to apply the methods to large scale problems with deep neural networks."

It doesn’t produce the big data~ the data is gigantic. Just one of the four experiments generates thousands gigabytes per second. The intensity of data flow is only going to be increased over the time. So the data processing techniques have to be quite sophisticated and unique. In this course we’ll introduce students into the main concepts of the Physics behind those data flow so the main puzzles of the Universe Physicists are seeking answers for will be much more transparent. Of course we will scrutinize the major stages of the data processing pipelines~ and focus on the role of the Machine Learning techniques for such tasks as track pattern recognition~ particle identification~ online real-time processing (triggers) and search for very rare decays.

algorithms,Genome Assembly Programming Challenge ,"In Spring 2011~ thousands of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and often led to kidney failure. It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history~ caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon~ German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lübeck~ where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point~ biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice – computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.

To investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain~ researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient~ which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They even used GitHub for the project: https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki

The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge~ you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome."

In particular~ this MOOC covers key Java programming language features that control the flow of execution through an app (such as Java’s various looping constructs and conditional statements)~ enable access to structured data (such as Java's built-in arrays and common classes in the Java Collections Framework~ such as ArrayList and HashMap)~ group related operations and data into classes and interfaces (such as Java's primitive and user-defined types~ fields~ methods~ generic parameters~ and exceptions)~ customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and polymorphism (such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods). Learners will apply these Java features in the context of core Android components (such as Activities and basic UI elements) by applying common tools (such as Android Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps.  

Learners will work on several hands-on projects throughout the MOOC~ i.e.~ each week will require learners to write solutions to programming assignments that reinforce the material covered in the lecture videos. There will be roughly 4-6 hours of student engagement time per week~ including video lectures~ quizzes~ and programming assignments."
mobile-and-web-development,Programming Languages~ Part A ,"This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages~ with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML~ Racket~ and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts~ but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages~ you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust~ reusable~ composable~ and elegant programs. Indeed~ many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.

The course assumes some prior experience with programming~ as described in more detail in the first module.

The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A~ Part B~ and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A~ the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material~ so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.

Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course~ but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean."

computer-security-and-networks,Networks: Friends~ Money~ and Bytes ,You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor~ get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one~ download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade~ but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere. In any case~ it costs you $10 per Gigabyte~ and you decide to stop watching the movie~ and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype~ while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality~ but get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work~ and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our daily lives~ but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering these 20 questions.
computer-security-and-networks,Internet of Things: Communication Technologies ,"Have you wondered how “Things” talk to each other and the cloud?

For example~ mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. After this course~ you will be able to describe how the nature of the threat evolves~ as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.

If you want to pursue a career in the public sector~ the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers~ inevitable human errors~ bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives~ and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations~ and consume substantial resources. The Pentagon~ for example~ has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum~ until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.

After completing the course modules you will be able to explain how yesterday’s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping advanced~ targeted attacks. Effective cybersecurity must be multi-dimensional and tiered~ as threats can originate from virtually anywhere~ target numerous levels of an organization~ and sometimes persist for months or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach. Therefore securing networks requires a holistic approach that incorporates several elements."

computer-security-and-networks,Networks Illustrated: Principles without Calculus ,"What makes WiFi faster at home than at a coffee shop? How does Google order its search results from the trillions of webpages on the Internet? Why does Verizon charge $15 for every GB of data we use? Is it really true that we are connected in six social steps or less?

These are just a few of the many intriguing questions we can ask about the social and technical networks that form integral parts of our daily lives. This course is about exploring the answers~ using a language that anyone can understand. We will focus on fundamental principles like “sharing is hard”~ “crowds are wise”~ and “network of networks” that have guided the design and sustainability of today’s networks~ and summarize the theories behind everything from the social connections we make on platforms like Facebook to the technology upon which these websites run.

Unlike other networking courses~ the mathematics included here are no more complicated than adding and multiplying numbers. While mathematical details are necessary to fully specify the algorithms and systems we investigate~ they are not required to understand the main ideas. We use illustrations~ analogies~ and anecdotes about networks as pedagogical tools in lieu of detailed equations.

Please note that per Princeton University policy~ no certificates~ credentials or reports are awarded in connection with this course."
computer-security-and-networks,Detecting and Mitigating Cyber Threats and Attacks ,Computer attacks and data breaches are inevitable.  It seems like every day a data breach occurs and the victims of the data breach suffer.  Their information is stolen or posted online.  The company’s or businesses who had the breach go on~ learn a little from the attack~ and just give credit monitoring out as if nothing happened.  What if you could help prevent a data breach in your organization?  This is the third course in the Practical Computer Security specialization.  This course looks at detection and mitigation of threats and attack vectors and discusses how to use tools and principles to protect information.  By the end of the course you should be able to make suggestions on what type of detection and mitigation strategy is right for your systems or business given the known threats and attack vectors.  You should be able to discuss what features you want in a firewall~ or how cash registers or sensitive data systems should be secured.  The project at the end of the course will allow you to apply what you have learned to argue what type of detection and mitigation strategies should have been employed by companies and businesses that have suffered a data breach.
computer-security-and-networks,Homeland Security & Cybersecurity Connection - It's Not About the Terrorists ,"Welcome to Course 1 in CS4950~ Homeland Security and Cybersecruity. In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its co0nnection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and manmade. For most of history the manmade variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th~ 1995. On that date~ members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups~ even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight~ the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred~ maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks~ the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11~ 2001~ nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7~ 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their ""surpassing disproportion"". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure~ turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again~ the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import~ fabricate~ or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again~ in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks~ which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure~ President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure~ but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation~ President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure~ especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11~ critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day~ but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection~ which is essential to homeland security~ which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.  Best wishes and good luck!

computer-security-and-networks,Symmetric Cryptography ,"Welcome to Symmetric Cryptography! 

Symmetric cryptography relies on shared secret key to ensure message confidentiality~ so that the unauthorized attackers cannot retrieve the message. The course describes substitution and transposition techniques~ which were the bases for classical cryptography when the message is encoded in natural language such as English. Then~ we build on product ciphers (using both substitution and transposition/permutation) to describe modern block ciphers and review the widely used cipher algorithms in DES~ 3-DES~ and AES. Lastly~ we enable the use of block ciphers to support variable data length by introducing different modes of block cipher operations in ECB~ CBC~ CFB~ OFB~ and CTR modes.

This course is cross-listed and is a part of the two specializations~ the Applied Cryptography specialization and the Introduction to Applied Cryptography specialization."

computer-security-and-networks,Cybersecurity Policy for Water and Electricity Infrastructures ,"This course will examine the drinking water and electricity infrastructures~ and various policies that have been developed to help guide and strengthen their cybersecurity programs.  The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as ""lifeline infrastructure"". The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water~ 2) energy~ 3) transportation~ and 4) communications. These sectors are designated ""lifeline"" because many other infrastructures depend upon them.  The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector~ and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector.  Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans.  The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013~ President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model~ which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on.  The Department of Energy~ though~ recommended voluntary application of the ES-C2M2. This module will examine both the drinking water and electricity lifeline infrastructure subsectors~ and elements and application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ES-C2M2."
computer-security-and-networks,Cybersecurity Policy for Aviation and Internet Infrastructures ,"In this course we will examine the aviation and Internet infrastructures~ and various policies that have been developed to help guide and strengthen their cybersecurity programs.  The aviation and Internet infrastructures are also considered ""lifeline infrastructure"" as part of the transportation and communications sectors. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively.  The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector.  While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector~ DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013~ both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors~ including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences~ the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.  That is to say~ they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards. This module will examine both the aviation and Internet lifeline infrastructure subsectors~ and elements and application of the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA."

design-and-product,Introduction to User Experience Design  ,"The focus of this course is to introduce the learner to User Experience (UX) Design

User Experience design is design that is user centered. The goal is to design artifacts that allow the users to meet their needs in the most effective efficient and satisfying manner. The course introduces the novice to a cycle of discovery and evaluation and a set of techniques that meet the user's needs.

This course is geared toward the novice. It is for learners that have heard about ""user experience"" or ""user interface"" design but don't really know much about these disciplines.

The course mantra is that “Design is a systematic and data driven process.” Design is systematic because it is based on a set of techniques and also on a cycle of discovery.

In this course the learner is introduced to the four step user interface design cycle. Along the way learners are exposed to a set of techniques to gather information about a) what the user needs b)how to design and model interfaces based on these and then how to evaluate the design to ascertain that the user's goals are met. These techniques are tools that are used in a standardized manner and give us the data we use in our design.

This means that anyone (regardless of their current training) that is willing to learn these techniques and follow the proposed cycle can be a UX designer!"

design-and-product,Introduction to Imagemaking ,"During this course~ we’ll be making exploratory images to expand your visual vocabulary. We'll create pieces that are expressive~ meditative~ or 'design-y' to instigate~ evoke~ experiment~ record~ explain~ or to try out a media. The first two weeks are experimental and exploratory; we won’t be concerned with meaning or communication (although~ to be honest~ every image does exist in a context~ and therefore communicates—or can convey—meaning~ connotation~ associations~ and expressiveness). 

In the second two weeks~ we’ll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition~ composition~ and context. Everyone has a natural~ intuitive way of putting things together. We’ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together~ composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context~ we look at how to intentionally drive the image’s connotations~ meanings and associations generated through elements of composition and “visual contrasts.” through style~ juxtaposition~ closure and figures of speech. 

Ultimately~ we will take the images that you create and make a book from them."

This course shows you how to integrate the practice of experimentation across concept testing~ usability testing~ functional testing~ and continuous deployment. 

Basically~ we’ll show you how to use experiments to answer these three big questions: 
     Should we build it? (And then: Did it matter?)
     Is it usable?
     Did it break?

We'll show you how to: 
- Translate your product’s strategic direction into a user-centric charter with lots of small~ testable ideas
- Test user motivation to make sure you’re building something that matters
- Design and conduct usability testing (even without working software)
- Use narrative collaboration to focus your testing 
- Integrate functional testing into a more continuous release flow

Interacting with a realistic client~ you will discern what they want and express what they truly need in software requirements to drive software production. Upon completing the capstone~ you will be prepared to advance your career as a confident software product management professional.
design-and-product,3D Interaction Design in Virtual Reality ,This course will teach you about one of the most important aspects of VR~ how you interact with a VR world. Virtual Reality is completely different from an on screen app or game. You are completely immersed in a VR world~ so it doesn't make sense to interact only through buttons or menus. You will get the most out of VR if you can interact with the world just as you would with the real world: with your natural body movements. You will learn about the basic concepts and technologies of VR Interaction. You will then get hands on~ learning about how to move around in VR and how to interact with the objects in your world. The course will finish with some advice from experts on VR interaction design and you will do a project where you will get real experience of developing VR Interaction.
design-and-product,Mobile Interaction Design: How to Design Usable Mobile Products and Services ,"Every mobile app gives you something. It could be not only something tangible like the pair of jeans you've ordered using the app but also a piece of work like waking you up in the morning. It could be a feeling~ for instance~ a feeling of enjoyment obtained from watching a video clip or a feeling of closeness flashed out after receiving an old photo from a loving person via some instant messenger. That ""something"" is actually the reason why you use the app~ it is the heart of the product~ and in this course we will not talk about it. Surprised? You shouldn’t be. There are always two sides of a coin. There should be a person who makes that ""something"" accessible. It is astonishingly important because the use of the product loses its meaning if users can’t get what they want.

The main objective of the course is to teach you to shape mobile products and services for people’s use. To do that~ you’ll need to learn:
- Interaction design activities and their place in the whole product design process
- User research methods with a focus on the qualitative ones
- Usability inspection and empirical usability evaluation methods
- The process of design creation and best practices from interaction design~ information architecture and visual design fields of study with a focus on the former
Interfaces of handheld devices and tablets are in the spotlight. However~ the processes and techniques covered by the course can be successfully applied to design interactions with mobile web apps and wearables. It should be noted that this course does not cover topics such as design management and mobile development~ and it will as well not teach you how to use wireframing and prototyping tools.

What makes the course unique is a focus on the way of thinking during a design process~ the representation of a designer’s decisions in the form of design questions that make the continuous reflection on the design process possible and leads to the growth of the number of proposed design alternatives. The second unique thing about this course is a focus on the explanation of the concept of usability problems~ and the processes of discovering and analysing them.

Upon completion of the course~ you will be able to:
- Improve designs by eliminating different kinds of interaction problems
- Design huge chunks of user interfaces in the case of adding a new feature to a product
- Redesign a complete app by a given set of functions (e.g.~ extending an existing product to a new platform)

The practical part of the course will require you to discover and eliminate interaction problems of a chosen mobile app. You will go through running guerrilla usability study~ analysing gathered data~ and making evidence-based design changes~ which will enable you to create your first case study."
design-and-product,World Design for Video Games ,"Start creating your world. A game world is not just a backdrop for your game—be it minimal or detailed~ contained or part of a much bigger universe~ it provides the context for your player. Ultimately~ a game world should feel alive and wholly unique to any player who will experience it. 

In this course~ we will explore game worlds in existing games and study the art and influences that inform their themes and styles. We will also investigate key components of environment and level design as well as strategies designers use to define gameplay or advance it. We’ll also look at navigation and the elements that make your world as real (or unreal) as you want it to be. A weekly challenge will prompt you to explore styles and inspirations for possible game worlds~ and you’ll learn effective ways to communicate your ideas from concepts to presentation-worthy proofs of concept."
design-and-product,Making Your First Virtual Reality Game ,"Virtual Reality is one of the most exciting experiences that technology can give us. The immersion and presence you can have in VR is quite unlike any other medium. Like many others~ you are excited about the possibilities of this new medium and want to get started developing your own VR experiences. This course will take you through all of the steps you need to create a VR game or other project. 

This is the final course in our Specialisation: Virtual Reality. The previous courses teach you the skills you need to make a VR game. This course brings them all together to create a project of your own. 

We will guide you through all the steps of a VR project: coming up with an idea~ storyboarding~ prototyping~ testing and implementation. By the end of this course you will have a complete VR project that demonstrates your skills and could be the first step in creating a professional game. 

We hope this course can be your entry into professional VR development. To help you get started~ some good advice always helps. That is why we have interviewed VR experts from all over the world~ ranging from technology pioneers with over 30 years experience in VR to the latest cutting edge VR creators. We have asked all of them to give you their advice and we hope it inspires you to become part of the future of VR."
design-and-product,System Validation: Automata and behavioural equivalences ,"Have you ever experienced software systems failing? Websites crash~ calendar not synchronising~ or even a power blackout. Of course you have! But did you know that many of these errors are the result of communication errors either within a system or between systems? Depending on the system~ the impact of software failures can be huge~ even resulting in massive economic damage or loss of lives. Software~ and in particular the communication between software-intensive systems~ is very complex and very difficult to get right. However~ we _need_ dependability in the systems we use~ directly or indirectly~ to support us in our everyday lives.

System Validation helps you to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound. It also enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful; systems that are designed for sound behaviour are also much easier to maintain and adapt. System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. The techniques put forward in system validaton allow to prove the absence of errors. 

This first course ’Automata and behavioural equivalences'~ builds the foundation of the subsequent courses~ showing you how to look at system behaviour as state machines. It discusses behavioural equivalences and illustrate these in a number of examples and quizzes. This course explains labelled transition systems or automata to model behaviour for especially software controlled systems. An important question is when two behaviours represented by such automata are equal. The answer to this question is not at all straightforward~ but the resulting equivalences are used as powerful tools to simplify complex behaviour. This allows us to exactly investigate and understand the behavioural properties of such systems precisely. Especially~ in the combination with hiding of behaviour~ equivalence reduction is a unique technique to obtain insight in the behaviour of systems~ far more effective than simulation or testing. Using this insight we can make the models correct. Such models form an excellent basis for the production of concise~ reliable and maintainable software.

This course is part I of the set of courses for System Validation. System Validation~ as a set of courses~ is part of a larger EIT Digital online programme called 'Internet of Things through Embedded Systems'."
design-and-product,Building Interactive 3D Characters and Social VR ,"Meeting another person is one of the most amazing experiences you can have in Virtual Reality. It is quite unlike communicating through any other medium except a real life face-to-face conversation. Because the other person is life size and shares a virtual space with you~ body language works in a way that cannot be done on a flat screen. This course will enable you to create realistic social interactions in VR. 

You will learn about both the psychology of social interaction and the practical skills to implement it in Unity3D. We will take you through the basics of 3D character animation and how to create body language. You will learn about how to make characters that can respond to players’ speech and body language. You will also learn about avatars: the virtual representation of other players~ and agents: computer controlled NPC characters and how to implement both of them. 

As many people have said before us~ social is the future of VR. This course will help you become part of the future of Virtual Reality social experiences."
design-and-product,Secure Networked System with Firewall and IDS ,In this MOOC~ we will focus on learning how network systems are secured using firewalls and IDS.  This will include understanding the basic components of network security~ constructing a dual-firewall DMZ~ and defining security policies to implement and enforce these rules.  Building upon these lessons we will go in-depth on the popular Linux firewall.  Finally we will learn about Network IDS and Host IDS~ including a deep dive into Snort.

data-analysis,Process Mining: Data science in Action ,"Process mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.

Data science is the profession of the future~ because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g.~ simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e.~ observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently~ but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals~ improving customer service processes in a multinational~ understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site~ analyzing failures of a baggage handling system~ and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence~ we refer to this as ""data science in action"".

The course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover~ the course will provide easy-to-use software~ real-life data sets~ and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.

This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.

The course covers the three main types of process mining.

1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.

2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here~ an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality~ as recorded in the log~ conforms to the model and vice versa.

3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here~ the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality~ this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information~ e.g.~ showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline~ but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases~ i.e.~ given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.

Process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between ""business"" and ""IT"". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.

The course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course~ one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.

After taking this course you should:
- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining)~
- understand the role of Big Data in today’s society~
- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation~ business intelligence~ data mining~ machine learning~ and verification~

data-analysis,Understanding China~ 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach~ Part 1 ,"The purpose of this course is to summarize new directions in Chinese history and social science produced by the creation and analysis of big historical datasets based on newly opened Chinese archival holdings~ and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.

Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts~ which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.

Part 1 (this course) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’.

Part 2 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-2) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality~ marriage~ and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal~ because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity~ and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.

For Deliverable 2~ the participant needs to present the intermediary outputs and adjustments to the analysis framework. The objectives is to confirm the how and the relevancy of the first results. 

Finally~ with Deliverable 3~ the participant needs to present the final outputs and the value case. The objective is to confirm the why. Why will it create value for public authorities~ companies~ and citizens.

Assessment and grading: the participants will present their results to their peers on a regular basis. An evaluation framework will be provided for the participants to assess the quality of each other’s deliverables."
data-analysis,Advanced Business Analytics Capstone ,"The analytics process is a collection of interrelated activities that lead to better decisions and to a higher business performance. The capstone of this specialization is designed with the goal of allowing you to experience this process. The capstone project will take you from data to analysis and models~ and ultimately to presentation of insights. 

In this capstone project~ you will analyze the data on financial loans to help with the investment decisions of an investment company. You will go through all typical steps of a data analytics project~ including data understanding and cleanup~ data analysis~ and presentation of analytical results. 
For the first week~ the goal is to understand the data and prepare the data for analysis. As we discussed  in this specialization~ data preprocessing and cleanup is often the first step in data analytics projects. Needless to say~ this step is crucial for the success of this project.  

In the second week~ you will perform some predictive analytics tasks~ including classifying loans and predicting losses from defaulted loans. You will try a variety of tools and techniques  this week~ as the predictive accuracy of different tools can vary quite a bit. It is rarely the case that the default model produced by ASP is the best model possible. Therefore~ it is important for you to tune the different models in order to improve the performance.

Beginning in the third week~ we turn our attention to prescriptive analytics~ where you will provide some concrete suggestions on how to allocate investment funds using analytics tools~ including clustering and simulation based optimization. You will see that allocating funds wisely is crucial for the financial return of the investment portfolio.

In the last week~ you are expected to present your analytics results to your clients. Since you will obtain many results in your project~ it is important for you to judiciously choose what to include in your presentation. You are also expected to follow the principles we covered in the courses in preparing your presentation."
data-analysis,Statistics with R Capstone ,"The capstone project will be an analysis using R that answers a specific scientific/business question provided by the course team. A large and complex dataset will be provided to learners and the analysis will require the application of a variety of methods and techniques introduced in the previous courses~ including exploratory data analysis through data visualization and numerical summaries~ statistical inference~ and modeling as well as interpretations of these results in the context of the data and the research question. The analysis will implement both frequentist and Bayesian techniques and discuss in context of the data how these two approaches are similar and different~ and what these differences mean for conclusions that can be drawn from the data.
 
A sampling of the final projects will be featured on the Duke Statistical Science department website.

Note: Only learners who have passed the four previous courses in the specialization are eligible to take the Capstone."
data-analysis,Data Mining Project ,"Note: You should complete all the other courses in this Specialization before beginning this course.

This six-week long Project course of the Data Mining Specialization will allow you to apply the learned algorithms and techniques for data mining from the previous courses in the Specialization~ including Pattern Discovery~ Clustering~ Text Retrieval~ Text Mining~ and Visualization~ to solve interesting real-world data mining challenges. Specifically~ you will work on a restaurant review data set from Yelp and use all the knowledge and skills you’ve learned from the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge. The design of the Project emphasizes: 1) simulating the workflow of a data miner in a real job setting; 2) integrating different mining techniques covered in multiple individual courses; 3) experimenting with different ways to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques; and 4) allowing you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively. 

The goal of the Project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. The project will include the following outputs: 

1. Opinion visualization: explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.
2. Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities.
3. Discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes of a particular cuisine.
4. Recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.

From the perspective of users~ a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they decide what cuisine to try~ they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally~ they will need to choose a restaurant. Thus~ recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful. Moreover~ predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant would also be helpful. 

By working on these tasks~ you will gain experience with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing~ data exploration~ data analysis~ improvement of analysis methods~ and presentation of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve it. We will suggest specific approaches~ but you are highly encouraged to explore your own ideas since open exploration is~ by design~ a goal of the Project. 

You are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks for peer grading. A final consolidated report is also required~ which will be peer-graded."

machine-learning,The Unix Workbench ,"Unix forms a foundation that is often very helpful for accomplishing other goals you might have for you and your computer~ whether that goal is running a business~ writing a book~ curing disease~ or creating the next great app. The means to these goals are sometimes carried out by writing software. Software can’t be mined out of the ground~ nor can software seeds be planted in spring to harvest by autumn. Software isn’t produced in factories on an assembly line. Software is a hand-made~ often bespoke good. If a software developer is an artisan~ then Unix is their workbench. Unix provides an essential and simple set of tools in a distraction-free environment. Even if you’re not a software developer learning Unix can open you up to new methods of thinking and novel ways to scale your ideas. 

This course is intended for folks who are new to programming and new to Unix-like operating systems like macOS and Linux distributions like Ubuntu. Most of the technologies discussed in this course will be accessed via a command line interface. Command line interfaces can seem alien at first~ so this course attempts to draw parallels between using the command line and actions that you would normally take while using your mouse and keyboard. You’ll also learn how to write little pieces of software in a programming language called Bash~ which allows you to connect together the tools we’ll discuss. My hope is that by the end of this course you be able to use different Unix tools as if they’re interconnecting Lego bricks."

Explore options to ensure your solution makes best use of the captured data. 
 
What technology is required to complete the course?  
The programming assignments require you to have a Raspberry Pi device - any model of Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. The course also uses the SenseHAT extension board~ whilst it is preferable to have a SenseHat there is a simulator provided if you can't get a SenseHAT.  

You will need internet connectivity to download software~ connect to the platform~ develop and deploy your IoT solution.

Your Rasberry Pi will need the latest Rasbian Jessie OS. This OS will be on a Micro SD Card. The recommended size of the SD card is 8GB but 4GB will do. Note that the learner kit comes with a preconfigured SD card.

In order to setup the Micro SD card~ you will need a computer with either a windows~ apple or Linux OS. Since most computer do not have a micro SD port~ you will need a Micro SD adapter or USB Micro SD card adapter. Your computer will also be used when working on the platform.

To work on your Raspberry Pi~ you will need an HDMI monitor or TV to work as the display for the Raspberry Pi (DVI monitor will also work). To connect the monitor to the Raspberry Pi you will need an HDMI cable (or a DVI to HDMI cable).
Your Raspberry Pi needs a way to connect to the internet; either an Ethernet cable for connecting to the Router~ or a USB WiFi dongle if you have wireless connectivity. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in WiFi
A USB Keyboard and mouse.

Your Raspberry Pi will also needs a 5V micro USB power supply i(This may be a phone charger for example)
There is an IoT Learner kit available from element14 which includes the Raspberry Pi~ a pre-flashed SD card~ a case and power supply : https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-82034/l/element14-iot-learner-kit 

What prerequisite skills are required ?
